In 1992, Bill Clinton looked me in the eye and promised that he would declare an all-out war on AIDS, institute a Manhattan-style project to cure AIDS, fully implement the 1991 commission reports, as well as provide presidential leadership to prevent the further spread of the disease. Yet three years later, those reports are still gathering dust, and we have yet to hear a prevention ad that says, kissing doesn't kill. Protect yourself from HIV. Always use a latex condom with a water-based lubricant each and every time you have anal or vaginal sex. When will we learn? When will this nation finally act up, fight back, and fight AIDS?

It is an absolutely critical moment for Governor Romney and we'll see whether all the practicing can pay off. Romney is a very calculating, data-driven guy. You tell him you get ninety seconds to answer a question on Libya, he's probably going to have a good answer. He's going to do well in the debates. He is the better debater, he's the more experienced debater, he had a lot of debates. I think you could argue that Mitt has had a lot more recent experience. He's very good under pressure. I think that the debates and especially the first debate will be vital. So I have absolute confidence that when we get to Thursday morning, George, all you are going to be shaking your head saying it's a brand new race. I think the first Presidential debate is the biggest night of Mitt Romney's political life now. ","A lot of Republicans are looking at October 3rd as a big date on the calendar. It's the first of three presidential debates and perhaps Mitt Romney's next best chance to try to regain some traction. Governor Romney has to shake things up Wednesday night, doesn't he? He's going to. I mean, every time Mitt Romney has been confronted in this campaign with one of these moments, he has come through in the debate and performed extraordinarily well. Is that another way of saying if he doesn't win these debates, he's not going to be president? Well, no challenger is going to become president if they can't stand up to incumbent president. I think what Mitt Romney needs is a game changer in the first debate. The fact of the matter is that has to be what happens after this first debate. The narrative has to change. The polls have to move. Romney has to clobber the president. What does it mean for Governor Romney? I mean, does it mean that the debates are basically make or break? Yeah, yes. In a word, yes. The debates are going to be the make or break point. Either he's going to change the public's perception of him as a potential president or not. It is an absolutely critical moment for Governor Romney, and we'll see whether or not he can make it. All the practicing can pay off. Romney is a very calculating, data-driven guy.
